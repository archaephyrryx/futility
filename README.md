futility
========

This repository exists as a unified history for a collection of utility
functions and type definitions that was previously shuttled between
multiple branches and repositories for personal projects.

As this is a recent transition, this source may be underdocumented, but some Haddock documentation is included
with a number of source files in this repository.

A more complete history of this collection can be found in the separate
repositories [CCG-Project](http://github.com/archaephyrryx/CCG-Project.git) and
[Starfinder](http://github.com/archaephyrryx/Starfinder.git).
